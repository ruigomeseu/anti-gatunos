## Anti Gatunos

AntiGatunos is a Laravel web application created to track and report armed robberies that occur near the [PÃ³lo II - Asprela](https://sigarra.up.pt/up/pt/web_base.gera_pagina?p_pagina=1005841) zone, in Oporto, Portugal.

### Why was it built?

A very large number of robberies were occuring near my college, and AntiGatunos.com surged as a quickly deployed solution that ended up helping all students fighting the crime wave.

You can read a bit more about this webapp [at my blog](http://blog.ruigomes.me/helping-my-college-fight-crime-with-antigatunos-com/).
